\section{Advanced Features}
\subsection{Custom and private datagrams}
\subsection{Protection against traffic analysis}
\subsection{Full-blockchain scraping}
As a means of reducing communication costs...
\subsection{Use of new opcodes}
New opcodes would enable processing of fresh attestation
\subsection{Protecting against freeloading}
\subsection{Principled data extraction}
Ultimately, we servers might themselves to act as ADFs. Possible migration path: (1) Town Crier; (2) XML labels on data; (3) Integration of Town Crier features into source directly
\subsection{Off-chain communication}
Mention use of Lamport signatures, etc.
\subsection{Revocation}
\subsection{Migration Path}
Ultimately, we expect sources themselves to act as ADFs. The migration path is : (1) Town Crier; (2) XML labels on data; (3) Integration of Town Crier features into source directly
\subsection{IoT support}
