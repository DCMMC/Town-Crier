\subsection{Basic terminology}
We refer to a {\em smart contract} making use of the \tcs service as a \emph{relying contract}. In contexts where a relying contract has issued to \tc a service request for a datagram, we call it a \emph{requester}. We denote a requester by \reqcont. A party (or would-be party) to a relying contract, a person, organization, or server, is a \emph{client}. Relying contracts---and requesters, by extension---are blockchain entities, while a client is an off-chain entity. A \emph{data source}, or \emph{source} for short, is an online server (running HTTPS) that provides data which \tc uses to compose datagrams.
