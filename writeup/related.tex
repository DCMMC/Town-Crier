Several data feeds are deployed today for smart contract systems such as Ethereum. Examples include PriceFeed and Oraclize.it. The latter achieves distributed trust by using a second service called TLSnotary, which digitally signs webpages. These services, however, ultimately rely on the reputations of their (small) providers to ensure data authenticity.  To address this problem, systems such as SchellingCoin and Augur~\cite{} have been proposed that rely on mechanisms such as prediction markets to decentralize trust. Prediction markets, however, can support only a limited number of data feeds and have not yet seen widespread use in cryptocurrencies. 

While a Windows SDK~\cite{} and programming manual~\cite{} for SGX have just been released, a number of pre-release papers have already explored SGX. Researchers have demonstrated applications include enclave execution of legacy (non-SGX) code~\cite{Haven} and use of SGX in a distributed setting for map-reduce computations~\cite{VC3}. Several works have exposed shortcomings of the security model for SGX~\cite{}, including side-channel and other attacks against enclave state.

How is the mapping from pages to data authenticated in Oraclize.it?
