\section{Related Work}

Several data feeds are deployed today for smart contract systems such as Ethereum. Examples include PriceFeed~\cite{PriceFeed:2016} and Oraclize.it~\cite{Oraclize:2016}. The latter achieves distributed trust by using a second service called TLSnotary~\cite{TLSnotary}, which digitally signs webpages. These services, however, ultimately rely on the reputations of their (small) providers to ensure data authenticity.  To address this problem, systems such as SchellingCoin~\cite{schellingcoin} and Augur~\cite{augur} rely on mechanisms such as human-driven prediction markets to decentralize trust. Prediction markets, however, can support only a limited number of data items and have not yet seen widespread use in cryptocurrencies. 

While a Windows SDK~\cite{sgxsdk} and programming manual~\cite{sgxmanual} for SGX have just been released, a number of pre-release papers have already described and explored SGX, e.g., \cite{Baumann:2015:SAU:2818727.2799647,7163017,7163052,anati2013innovative,McKeen:2013jv,Phegade:2013km}. Researchers have demonstrated applications include enclave execution of legacy (non-SGX) code~\cite{Haven} and use of SGX in a distributed setting for map-reduce computations~\cite{VC3}. Several works have exposed shortcomings of the security model for SGX~\cite{sgxexplained,sgxsok,shihardwaretalk}, including side-channel and other attacks against enclave state.
