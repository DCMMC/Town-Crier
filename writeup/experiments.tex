\subsection{Gas costs}

At the writing of this paper, 1 ether is worth approximately \$0.20, and 1 gas costs $5 \cdot 10^{-8}$ ether.
This means that 1 million gas costs approximately \$0.01.
The required gas to execute each of the of the entry points to \tcont is as follows:
\begin{itemize}
  \item {\bf Request}.
    This is the most expensive entry point due to the cost of storing data.
    This costs approximately 141000 gas plus 22600 more for every 32 bytes of request parameters $\dgform$.

  \item {\bf Deliver}.
    This costs approximately 30000 gas plus 2600 for every 32 bytes of request parameters
    plus the cost of executing the callback, which is entirely determined by the requester.

  \item {\bf Cancel}.
\end{itemize}
