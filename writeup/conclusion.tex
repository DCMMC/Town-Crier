\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

We have introduced \tcs (\tc), an authenticated data feed for smart contracts specifically designed to support Ethereum. 
%: A financial derivative, a flight insurance contract, and a contract that sells virtual goods for ether. 
Thanks to its use of Intel's new SGX trusted hardware, \tc serves datagrams with a high degree of trustworthiness. We prove in a formal model capturing SGX and blockchain behavior that \tc serves only data from authentic sources. We also prove that its novel gas-management system achieves sustainable gas use if the unprotected server code (outside SGX) in \tc behaves honestly and minimizes gas losses should the code behave maliciously. In experiments involving end-to-end use of the complete system with the Ethereum blockchain, we demonstrated \tc's practicality, cost effectiveness, and flexibility for three example  smart contract applications. We believe that \tc offers a powerful and practical means to address the lack of trustworthy data feeds hampering Ethereum evolution today and support a rich range of applications. Pending deployment of the Intel attestation verification service in the near future, we will make \tc freely available as a public service.
