\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclude}

We have introduced \tcs (\tc), an authenticated data feed for smart contracts specifically designed to support Ethereum.
Use of Intel's new SGX trusted hardware allows \tc to serve datagrams with a high degree of trustworthiness.
We defined \emph{gas sustainability}, a critical availability property of Ethereum services,
and provided techniques for shrinking the size of a hybrid TCB spanning the blockchain and an SGX.
We proved in a formal model that \tc serves only data from authentic sources,
and showed that \tc is gas sustainable and minimizes cost to honest users should the code behave maliciously.
In experiments involving end-to-end use of the system with the Ethereum blockchain, we demonstrated \tc's practicality, cost effectiveness, and flexibility for three example applications.
We believe that \tc offers a powerful, practical means to address the lack of trustworthy data feeds hampering Ethereum evolution today and that it will support a rich range of applications.
Pending deployment of the Intel Attestation Service (IAS), we will make a version of \tc freely available as a public service.
